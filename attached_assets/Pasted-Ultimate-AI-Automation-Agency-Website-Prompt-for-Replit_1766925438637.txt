Remove will-change after animation complete
Reduce Complexity:

Limit particle count on lower-end devices
Detect device performance, scale effects accordingly
Disable heavy effects on mobile
RequestAnimationFrame:

Use for all JavaScript animations
Throttle scroll listeners
Debounce resize handlers
Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA Compliant)Keyboard Navigation:
